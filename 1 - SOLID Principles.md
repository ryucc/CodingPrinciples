# SOLID Principles

There are plenty of literature of SOLID principles. A lot of them explain it better than I ever will.

Stating the SOLID principles here because


## Single responsibility principle
It's straight forward, one class should do one thing. I comply to this principle in the nesting chapter and the naming chapter.
 In my ideal world, we can produce readable code without comments. The class name and method names should be ample to explain what your method does. It's like twitter, where there is a word limit for the explaination; you are limited to using the method names. It ties back to Single responsiblitity principle, becaue if you can't explain what a class does in a few short words, probably it is doing too much. The "Getting rid of Nesting" chapter is a different approach. If your code contains a lot of nesting, same as branches, it might also be doing too much, violating the SRP. In those chapters I will explain how I refactor the code or do the naming.
